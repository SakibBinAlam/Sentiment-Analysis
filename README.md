# Sentiment-Analysis

This project classifies a set of tweets into two categories:racist and non-recist. 
Here I implemented several feature extraction techniques and machine learning algorithms to build models. 
Performance of different methods were analyzed and compared. XGBoost with Word2Vec model has given us the best performance so far.
