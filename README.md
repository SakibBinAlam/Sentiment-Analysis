# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

This project classifies a set of tweets into two categories:racist/sexist and non-recist. 
Here I implemented several feature techniques and algorithms for modeling. 
After analyzing their performances finally selected the optimal techniques. Python was used to build this project.
